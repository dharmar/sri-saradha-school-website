  <br>
  The correspondent, the staff and the students take immense pleasure in welcoming you to our School and our website https://www.srisaradhaschool.com. It provides comprehensive and detailed information about our school.<br>
  <br>
  Education plays a vital role in the growth and development of human beings. It should not only give good knowledge but should be an encouraging factor for the all-around growth of a child. It should mold his/her character and motivate him/her to develop his/her personality. We strive to achieve this in our school by inculcating the basic values of life in their young age itself.<br>
  <br.
  India is an ancient country, with varied heritage, culture, and traditions. Keeping this in mind the students are made to understand the heritage of our country, as desired by Thirumathi Unnamalai Thayammal the founder of Siruvar Kalikoodam. Her vision was to instill our culture and values to the children of 3 – 5 years old. <br>
  <br>
  We aim to find the strength and weaknesses of our children and develop their personalities so that they have a very positive attitude towards life and have mental strength and self-confidence to face the challenges of this competitive world. They should be physically and mentally prepared to be successful in all the competitions. We endeavor to mold their character to have a bright and prosperous future with the blessings of their parents, teachers, and THE Great Almighty and be a responsible citizen of our country, who needs his/her contribution to be self-reliant.<br>
  <br>
  Happy Learning!!!<br>
  Jai Hind.
